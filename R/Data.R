#' Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Dataset
#' @name ecls_data
#' @docType data
#' @usage data(ecls_data)
#'
#' @description The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) dataset tracks more than 18,000 children
#' from kindergarten through fifth grade, providing comprehensive student-level information. See Tourangeau et al. (2015) for details.
#'
#' @details The dataset includes fifth-grade cross-sectional data, focusing on students' mathematical
#' assessment scores as the primary outcome measure. The mathematical assessment covers 18 topics
#' such as number sense, properties, operations, measurement, geometry, data analysis, and algebra.
#' These items evaluate students' competencies in conceptual knowledge, procedural knowledge, and
#' problem-solving, consolidated into a single "Math score." A higher score indicates greater proficiency.
#' The primary predictors are household income and gender, where gender is a categorical variable.
#' Household income is categorized into 18 ordinal levels, ranging from $5,000 or less (level 1) to
#' $200,000 or more (level 18). In the analysis, the income variable is treated as a continuous variable.
#' The dataset removes all records with missing values and consists of 9,101 complete observations from 2,275 schools.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 9,101 observations, including:
#'   \describe{
#'   \item{Child_ID}{Unique identifier for each child in the dataset.}
#'   \item{School_ID}{Identifier for each school in the dataset.}
#'   \item{Math_Score}{Continuous variable representing the consolidated math proficiency score.}
#'   \item{Income}{Household income, categorized into 18 ordinal levels, from $5,000 or less to $200,000 or more. Treated as a continuous variable in the analysis.}
#'   \item{Child_Sex}{Binary variable indicating the gender of each student.}
