\title{Calculate direct/indirect standardized ratios/rates from a fitted \code{logis_cre} object}
\usage{
\method{SM_output}{logis_cre}(
  fit,
  parm,
  stdz = "indirect",
  measure = c("rate", "ratio"),
  threads = 2,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{a model fitted from \code{logis_cre}.}

\item{parm}{specifies a subset of providers for which confidence intervals are to be given.
By default, all providers are included. The class of \code{parm} should match the class of the provider IDs.}

\item{stdz}{a character string or a vector specifying the standardization method(s).
The possible values are:
\itemize{
\item{\code{"indirect"}} (default) indirect standardization method.
\item{\code{"direct"}} direct standardization method.
\item{\code{c("indirect", "direct")}} outputs both direct and indirect standardized measures.
}}

\item{measure}{a character string or a vector indicating whether the output measure is "ratio" or "rate"
\itemize{
\item{\code{"rate"}} output the standardized rate. The "rate" has been restricted to 0\% - 100\%.
\item{\code{"ratio"}} output the standardized ratio.
\item{\code{c("ratio", "rate")}} (default) output both the ratio and rate.
}}

\item{threads}{an integer specifying the number of threads to use. The default value is 2.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments that can be passed to the function.}
}
\value{
A list contains standardized measures, as well as the observed and expected outcomes used for calculation,
depending on the user's choice of standardization method (\code{stdz}) and measure type (\code{measure}).
\item{indirect.ratio}{standardization ratio using indirect method if \code{stdz} includes \code{"indirect"} and \code{measure} includes \code{"ratio"}.}
\item{direct.ratio}{standardization ratio using direct method if \code{stdz} includes \code{"direct"} and \code{measure} includes \code{"ratio"}.}
\item{indirect.rate}{standardization rate using indirect method if \code{stdz} includes \code{"indirect"} and \code{measure} includes \code{"rate"}.}
\item{direct.rate}{standardization rate using direct method if \code{stdz} includes \code{"direct"} and \code{measure} includes \code{"rate"}.}
\item{OE}{a list of data frames containing the observed and expected outcomes used for calculating standardized measures.}
}
